#generator-cg-angular15

>Yeoman Generator for Enterprise Angular 1 Projects with TypeScript, Webpack, and Sass.

Features

* Component-Oriented.  Develop using Angular 1.5's new `component()` helper to create component-centric apps.
* Includes a complete Webpack configuration using Yarn for package management.
* Use TypeScript.
* Provides a directory structure geared towards large Angular projects.
    * Each component, service, filter, and directive are placed in their own file.
    * All files related to a conceptual unit are placed together.  For example, the controller, HTML, SCSS, and unit test for a component are placed together in the same directory.
* Includes Yeoman subgenerators for components, directives, services, filters, and modules.
* Integrates Sass and includes Bootstrap via the source SCSS files allowing you to reuse Bootstrap vars/mixins/etc.
* Easily Testable - Each sub-generator creates a skeleton unit test.  Unit tests can be run via `yarn test`.

Directory Layout
-------------
All subgenerators prompt the user to specify where to save the new files.  Thus you can create any directory structure you desire, including nesting.  The generator will create a handful of files in the root of your project including `index.html`, `app.ts`, `app.scss`, etc.  You determine how the rest of the project will be structured.

In this example, the user has chosen to group the app into an `admin` folder, a `search` folder, and a `service` folder.

    index.html ..................... main HTML file
    index.ts ....................... main TS file that includes the imports for the app's components
    index.scss ..................... main SCSS file that includes the @import's for the components' styles
    app.ts ......................... angular module initialization and route setup
    app.scss ....................... main app-wide styles
    /search ........................ example search feature folder
      my-filter.ts ................. example filter
      my-filter-spec.ts ............ example filter unit test
      /search-component ............ example component
        search-component.html ...... example component html
        search-component.ts ........ example component configuration/controller
        search-component.scss ...... example component SCSS
        search-component-spec.ts ... example component unit test
    /admin ......................... example admin module folder
      admin.ts ..................... admin module initialization and route setup
      admin.scss ................... admin module SCSS
      /admin-directive1 ............ angular directives folder
        admin-directive1.ts ........ example simple directive
        admin-directive1-spec.ts.... example simple directive unit test
      /admin-directive2 ............ example complex directive (contains external partial)
        admin-directive2.ts ........ complex directive typescript
        admin-directive2.html ...... complex directive partial
        admin-directive2.scss ...... complex directive SCSS
        admin-directive2-spec.ts ... complex directive unit test
    /service ....................... angular services folder
        my-service.ts .............. example service
        my-service-spec.ts ......... example service unit test
        my-service2.ts ............. example service
        my-service2-spec.ts ........ example service unit test
    /dist .......................... distributable version of app built using `yarn run build`.

Getting Started
-------------

Prerequisites: Node, Yarn.  Once Node is installed, do:

    yarn global add yo karma webpack webpack-dev-server typings generator-cg-angular15

To create a project:

    mkdir MyNewAwesomeApp
    cd MyNewAwesomeApp
    yo cg-angular15

Yarn Scripts
-------------

Now that the project is created, you have 3 simple Yarn commands available:

    yarn start       #This will run a development server with livereload (i.e. the webpack-dev-server).
    yarn test        #Runs unit tests with Karma.
    yarn run build   #Places a fully optimized build (minified, concatenated, and more) in /dist

Yeoman Subgenerators
-------------

There are a set of subgenerators to initialize empty Angular components.  Each of these generators will:

* Create one or more skeleton files (typescript, scss, html, spec etc) for the component type.
* Update index.ts and include the necessary `import`s.
* Update app.scss and add the `@import` as needed.
* For components, update the app.ts, adding the necessary route call if a route was entered in the generator prompts.

There are generators for `component`, `directive`, `service`, `filter`, `module`, and `modal`.

Running a generator:

    yo cg-angular15:component my-awesome-component
    yo cg-angular15:directive my-directive
    yo cg-angular15:service my-service
    yo cg-angular15:filter my-filter
    yo cg-angular15:module my-module
    yo cg-angular15:modal my-modal

The name paramater passed (i.e. 'my-awesome-component') will be used as the file names.  The generators will derive appropriate class names from this parameter (ex. 'my-awesome-component' will convert to a class name of 'MyAwesomeComponent').  Each sub-generator will ask for the folder in which to create the new skeleton files.  You may override the default folder for each sub-generator in the `.yo-rc.json` file.

The modal subgenerator is a convenient shortcut to create partials that work as modals for Bootstrap v3 and Angular-UI-Bootstrap (both come preconfigured with this generator).  If you choose not to use either of these libraries, simply don't use the modal subgenerator.

Submodules
-------------

Submodules allow you to more explicitly separate parts of your application.  Use the `yo cg-angular15:module my-module` command and specify a new subdirectory to place the module into.  Once you've created a submodule, running other subgenerators will now prompt you to select the module in which to place the new component.

ES2015/TypeScript Module Imports
-------------

When importing most CommonJS/ES5 modules, you'll need to use the syntax:

```js
import * as angular from 'angular';
```

The _default_ syntax, shown below, will NOT work.

```js
import angular from 'angular';
```

Preconfigured Libraries
-------------

The new app will have a handful of preconfigured libraries included.  This includes Angular 1.5, Bootstrap 3, AngularUI Bootstrap, FontAwesome, JQuery, Lodash, and Moment.  You may of course add to or remove any of these libraries.
